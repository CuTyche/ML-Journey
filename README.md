# ML-Journey
# 🍪 ML Den 🧠✨

Welcome to my cozy little corner of Machine Learning where code meets curiosity!  
This repo is my digital diary of learning ML — one algorithm, one experiment, one "wtf-is-gradient-descent" at a time 🐾💻

## 🧁 What's Cooking?

📌 Phase 1: Python & Math for ML
(You can skip Python basics if you already know it)

✅ Python basics (variables, loops, functions)

✅ NumPy

✅ Pandas

✅ Matplotlib & Seaborn

✅ Statistics & Probability for ML

✅ Linear Algebra basics

✅ Calculus essentials (derivatives, gradients)

🤖 Phase 2: Core ML Concepts
💡 What is Machine Learning?

💡 Types: Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement

🧠 ML lifecycle: data → model → evaluation → deploy

🔢 Phase 3: Supervised Learning (Regression + Classification)
📈 Regression Algorithms
Linear Regression

Polynomial Regression

Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet Regression

XGBoost & Gradient Boosting Regressors

🏷️ Classification Algorithms
Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Naive Bayes

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

XGBoost & Gradient Boosting Classifiers

🧩 Phase 4: Unsupervised Learning
K-Means Clustering

Hierarchical Clustering

PCA (Dimensionality Reduction)

🧹 Phase 5: Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
Handling missing values

Encoding categorical data (Label, One-Hot)

Feature Scaling (StandardScaler, MinMax)

Feature Selection Techniques

Outlier Detection

📊 Phase 6: Model Evaluation & Selection
Train/Test Split

Cross-Validation

Bias-Variance Tradeoff

Confusion Matrix

Precision, Recall, F1-score

ROC-AUC Curve

🚀 Phase 7: Model Deployment
Saving model with Pickle/Joblib

Flask-based Web App

Streamlit deployment

Heroku deployment (optional)

💻 Phase 8: Real-Time Projects
Krish Naik usually recommends 3+ projects to show end-to-end knowledge:

Project Idea	Dataset
House Price Prediction	Kaggle Housing
Email Spam Classifier	UCI Spam Dataset
Customer Segmentation	Mall Customers
Fake News Detector	News Article Dataset
Resume Screening	NLP + Classification
Loan Approval Prediction	CSV from Kaggle
Diabetes Prediction	Pima Indian Diabetes
